# CLBR Calculator

The CLBR Calculator is an interactive tool developed to provide insights into the potential outcomes of assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments, specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF). It draws upon the research findings from the paper titled "The combined effect of BMI and age on ART outcomes", published in *Human Reproduction* journal, Volume 38, Issue 5, on May 1, 2023. The study, authored by Filipa Rafael, Maria Dias Rodrigues, Jose Bellver, Mariana Canelas-Pais, Nicolas Garrido, Juan A Garcia-Velasco, SÃ©rgio Reis Soares, and Samuel Santos-Ribeiro, explores the interplay between a woman's body mass index (BMI), her age, and the outcomes of ART treatments. The paper can be accessed [here](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/38/5/886/7079091?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_campaign=Human_Reproduction_TrendMD_1&utm_medium=cpc).

The research highlights a critical consideration in the field of reproductive medicine: whether women with infertility and overweight/obesity should delay IVF treatment to first promote weight loss.

This interactive CLBR Calculator allows users to input their personal health information (such as weight, height, and age) and see how these factors might influence their cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) based on the study's findings.
